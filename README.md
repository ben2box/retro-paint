# retro-paint
An afternoon well spent in my first weeks learning Java, developing what I imagine the ancestor of Paint looked like.

To play around with it, simply clone the repo and run the main class.

## Controls
- Arrow keys to move;
- Spacebar to paint (hold it down to keep painting);
- "C" to clear the painted square (hold it down to keep clearing).
